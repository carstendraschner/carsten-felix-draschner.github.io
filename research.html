        "<em>SimE4KG: Distributed Explainable multi-modal Semantic Similarity Estimation for Knowledge Graphs</em>", 2023 International Journal of Semantic Computing, DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S1793351X23600012">10.1142/S1793351X23600012</a>.
        We present the SimE4KG framework, which provides generic open-source modules for computing semantic similarity estimation in multi-modal KGs. SimE4KG delivers reproducible, reusable, and explainable results to justify the computing costs of similarity estimation. The pipeline outcomes are a native semantic RDF-KG, including the experiment results, hyper-parameter setup, and result explanation, as the most influential features. We utilized Apache Spark to develop a distributed strategy for efficient and scalable execution in memory. This framework's overall development is integrated into the SANSA distributed semantic analytics stack.

        "<em>Ethical and Sustainability considerations for Knowledge Graphs based Machine Learning</em>", 2022 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (AIKE), DOI: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9939282">10.1109/AIKE55402.2022.00015</a>.
        This paper presents ethical and sustainability considerations in KG-based ML. These are presented along the classical R&D life-cycle, including responsible AI check, technical system setup, data insights, machine learning, training & evaluation, and finally, deployment. Each of these steps is introduced by multiple sub-dimension. These are structured by definition, explaining challenges, providing examples, stating research questions, and offering recommendations. We also investigate data validity, bias, and privacy-related concerns of KG data in ML pipelines. The ethical and explainability dimension, as well as the sustainability aspect of processing power-intensive KG-based ML, are presented.

        <em>DistRDF2ML - Scalable Distributed In-Memory Machine Learning Pipelines for RDF Knowledge Graphs</em>. Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management (CIKM). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 4465–4474. DOI: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459637.3481999">10.1145/3459637.3481999</a>.
        The generic, scalable, and distributed framework DistRDF2ML is presented for building in-memory data preprocessing pipelines for Spark-based ML on RDF KGs. This framework includes software modules that convert large-scale RDF data into fixed-length numeric feature vectors suitable for ML. The generated modules are tailored to KGs' multi-modal nature. The pipeline's modules, hyper-parameters, and outputs are all exported in a semantic structure that can be utilized to improve the original KG. The semantic representation of metadata and ML outcomes has the advantage of enhancing the reusability, explainability, and reproducibility of ML processes.

        <em>Literal2Feature: An automatic scalable RDF graph feature extractor</em>, in: Further with Knowledge Graphs, International Conference on Semantic Systems, (SEMANTICS), IOS Press, 2021, pp. 74–88. DOI: <a href="https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/57407">10.3233/SSW210036</a>.
        Literal2Feature is a generic, distributed, and scalable software framework for translating massive RDF data into an explainable feature matrix. Many standard ML algorithms can make use of this matrix. Our method uses Semantic Web and Big Data technologies to extract a variety of features from a big RDF graph by deep traversing it. The proposed framework is open-source, technically documented, and wholly integrated into the Semantic Analytics Stack community project.

        DistSim includes several feature-based graph entity similarity estimators. The Similarity Estimation Pipeline was created by merging generic software modules. DistSim introduces MinHash with locality sensitivity hashing for large-scale RDF data to improve scalability over all-pair similarity estimations. DistSim's modules can be configured using a variety of (hyper-)parameters to manage the trade-off between information considered and processing time. Furthermore, the similarity estimation pipeline's output is native RDF. DistSim is part of the SANSA stack, with documentation in Scala-docs and unit tests.

        <strong>PhD Thesis by Carsten Felix Draschner, Dr.rer.nat, supervisors: Jens Lehmann and Stefan Wrobel</strong>
        <em>Scalable Distributed Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs</em>, 2022, University of Bonn, <a href="https://bonndoc.ulb.uni-bonn.de/xmlui/handle/20.500.11811/10945">link</a>.
        Within this work, we developed novel approaches for Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs while considering ethical and sustainability dimensions. In particular, we developed technologies that create fixed-length numeric feature vectors. These include methods that, like graph kernels, extract features from the graph in the context of the map-reduce operations relevant for distributed computation. The feature extraction also includes the multi-modal data of KG literals. Accordingly, we have developed methods that enable SPARQL-based feature extraction and assist in creating complex feature-extracting queries. Based on these extracted features, we further contributed scalable, distributed, and explainable ML and data analytics methods such as semantic similarity estimation and classification or regression ML pipelines demonstrating noticeable performance. We support the transparency, reusability, and reproducibility of our novel open-source approaches by results and meta-data semantification. This semantification transfers the original graph data with the hyper-parameter setup and explainability information, in addition to the predicted results of the ML pipelines, into a semantic native KG. Due to the technological complexity, we enable the application of our algorithm technologies through complementary work such as the use in coding notebooks and the use in Rest API-based environments. Our work also describes the multidimensional and interwoven optimization dimensions of ethical and sustainable KG-based ML. We extended the existing technology stack SANSA, which is used for distributed processing and native semantic data handling, by several scientific publications and software framework releases to offer these functionalities for distributed ML on KGs.

        <em>The development of complexity in chip design and its visualization within Virtual Reality</em>, 2016, University of Bonn.
        This research project presents a novel approach to visualizing complex chip designs using Virtual Reality (VR) technology. By dynamically loading detailed 3D models, we enable users to interactively explore and understand the intricate structures of chip designs without noticeable loading times. Our VR application provides an immersive experience, offering a more engaging and informative way to visualize chip designs compared to traditional 2D plots or 3D applications on a monitor. The integration of various views and tools enhances the user experience, providing valuable insights for both experts and non-experts. User testing with a diverse group of participants yielded overwhelmingly positive feedback, confirming the effectiveness of our approach. This project demonstrates the potential of VR technology in facilitating the understanding and exploration of complex technical designs, and contributes to the development of innovative applications in the field of chip design and visualization.

        Setting up a distributed in-memory cluster computation system with all its dependencies and environments can be challenging, and it may also necessitate significant processing power. We lower the entry barriers for analyzing and testing the SANSA framework's capabilities and potentially bringing this technology to production using only the browser. We show how to run the SANSA stack within Databricks without requiring extra Apache Spark knowledge or installs.

        Developing distributed KG-based ML pipelines demands in-depth knowledge and experience in computer systems, networking, distributed computing, and other related fields. Furthermore, even if developers have the technical skills, creating such a cluster takes time and effort. To address the challenges mentioned above, we present a micro-service Rest-API-based architecture that allows end-users to readily access the capabilities of SANSA and distributed semantic data analysis without requiring technical expertise in these domains.
